Thesis Work - Nix.dev in automotive software development,https://annonsportal.chalmers.se/CareerServices/en/Ads/Details/2929,Volvo Cars,N/A,Sweden,2024-11-25,"Background
Automotive software development is becoming increasingly complex, with growing demands on reliability, security, and product quality. Traditional approaches to building and packaging automotive software often fall short in ensuring reproducibility and consistency across different environments. This research aims to explore the potential of leveraging Nix.dev facilities to improve the devsecops lifecycle in the automotive domain


Scope
A successful study will focus on investigating the feasibility and potential benefits of applying Nix.dev packaging facilities to a small subset of Volvo's automotive software development. This research aims to identify the advantages and challenges associated with this approach in the context of automotive systems.

The NextG2Com website : https://www.nextg2com.lu.se/english/


Specifically, the scope of this thesis includes:
• An analysis of Nix.dev facilities and their potential applications in the automotive domain.
• Packaging some components using nix.dev for demonstration purposes
• Empirical evaluation through a case study involving Volvo's development process
• Expert panel feedback from Volvo experts to validate findings.
By exploring this scope, the research aims to contribute to the understanding of how Nix.dev packaging facilities can improve devsecops practices and overall product quality in the automotive industry.


Do you fit the profile
A successful candidate has
• Love for Linux/Unix OSes
• Background in Software Engineering and/or Computer Science
• Understanding of package management concepts
• Basic knowledge of shell scripting
• Experience with version control systems like Git
It is meritorious to have
• Experience with Gerrit code review tool (or similar)
• Some experience with nix*


Duration
• The work will start in 2025 (exact date up to the students)
• The duration for this thesis work is 20 weeks.
• 30 ECTS (academic credits) if in agreement with your Thesis Advisor in University
• This thesis is to be conducted by 2 Students working in pair.
